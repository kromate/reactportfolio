        There is really nothing special about me ðŸ˜¶
        But if you really want to know what differentiates me from the rest

        So if you in search for someone that can deliver, then am your guy.
        what else ðŸ¤” hmmm, am nineteen with three years of software development experience, Upcoming B.Engr in computer Engineering (Hopefully ), Founder of Kromtech (We build softwares to help out students and make their lifes easier). I think that's all, If you want to find out more hit me up on twitter Also check out my Vanilla Js portfolio, it has more content on me ( I guess )
