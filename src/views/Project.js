import React from 'react'
import Card from '../component/Card';

function Project() {
  return (
    <div className='flexColumn'>
      <h1>This page is left blank intentionally</h1>
      <Card>
        Calm down.... let me explain
      </Card>
      <Card>
        So in order to keep this page always updated, i decided instead of hard coding the projects into the application why don't i redirect you to a more updated readme of all my React projects
        Why this could have been achieved by an API and Markup (The JAMstack way),it's just extra work i wish not to do
      </Card>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Project
